# nginx-http-sentinel-module

`ngx_http_sentinel_module` — a single access-phase **client-reputation + tarpit**
engine for nginx / angie. Fuses three defenses that all share one shape
("score the client, then act"):

1. **CrowdSec reputation** — consume crowd-sourced + local-WAF ban decisions
   (out of band; never blocks the request path).
2. **AI-scraper / bad-bot tarpit** — when the score is bad, serve a cheap,
   bounded garbage drip instead of a clean 403, starving LLM scrapers and
   hostile crawlers.
3. **JA4+ fingerprinting** — JA4H (HTTP header order, in-module, Phase 1) feeds
   the score and survives TLS randomization that defeats JA3/IP alone. JA4 (TLS
   ClientHello) is **deferred to Phase 4** — it needs a core nginx patch
   (ClientHello SSL callback), so it can't live in a pure HTTP module; JA4H
   covers most TLS-randomized bots until then.

**Self-contained: one module, no runtime sibling deps.** Sentinel *absorbs* the
signal logic it needs (error-rate/scanner-path counter, UA/bot heuristics,
JA4H) into its own source rather than reading sibling runtime vars. Phase 1–3
ship with **zero core nginx patch**. The standalone `nginx-error-abuse-module`
is **deprecated later** once sentinel's native error-rate signal covers it.

> **Status: planning / Phase 0.** No module code yet. The full phased build plan
> is in [TODO.md](TODO.md); the locked design decisions and safety rules are in
> [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). Read those before writing code.

## Why one module

All three are the same pipeline at one decision point (`PREACCESS`):

```
request ──► [sentinel] ─► score = w1·crowdsec(ip)        (Phase 3, out-of-band)
                                 + w2·bot/UA signal       (in-module)
                                 + w3·error-burst          (in-module, absorbed)
                                 + w4·scanner-path         (in-module)
                                 + JA4H(headers)           (in-module)
                                 [+ JA4 TLS  — Phase 4, needs core patch]
            verdict:  low → allow
                      mid → challenge (built-in PoW / optional js-challenge)
                      hi  → tarpit (bounded drip)
                      max → 403
```

## Design pillars (see DESIGN.md)

- **No network in the request path** — per-request is a pure shared-memory
  lookup. Reputation data is loaded out of band. No added latency, no
  slowloris-against-yourself.
- **Fail-open by default** — a lookup/zone error logs and allows; `closed` is
  opt-in.
- **Bounded tarpit** — global concurrent-connection cap, tiny timers, fixed
  buffers, hard max lifetime. Never a self-DoS.
- **Self-contained** — every signal computed in-module; no runtime sibling-module
  dependency. Logic ported from `error-abuse` (error-rate), `bot-verifier` /
  `user-agent` (bot/UA), JA4H (in-module) into sentinel's own source.
- **Zero core patch in Phase 1–3** — JA4H + error-rate + UA/bot + CrowdSec all
  pure-HTTP / out-of-band. JA4 (TLS) needs a core nginx ClientHello patch, so it
  is deferred to Phase 4 (added only when JA4H evasion shows in traffic).

## See also

- Sibling own-modules: `nginx-autocert-module`, `nginx-error-abuse-module`
  (error-rate + CI-harness source — **sentinel absorbs its logic; standalone
  deprecated later**), `nginx-strip-filter-module`, `nginx-cache-turbo-module`,
  `nginx-label-autoconf-module`.
- Ships in the deb.myguard.nl nginx/angie build (`/opt/packages`).

## Development

- Work on `dev`; feature branches `feat/<phase>` → PR to **`dev`** (local CI only,
  no remote CI). `master` PRs are unsquashed + remote-CI, opened on request only.
- Build/test standalone: `bash tools/ci-build.sh`. valgrind + fuzz run manually +
  monthly (remote workflow) and weekly (local cron).
